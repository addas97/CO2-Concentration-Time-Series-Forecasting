# CO2-Concentration-Time-Series-Forecasting
A time series forecasting project modeling atmospheric CO2 using polynomial regression and seasonal decomposition. It fits linear, quadratic, and cubic trends, adds monthly periodic effects, and evaluates model accuracy with RMSE and MAPE. Final model captures both long-term and seasonal patterns.
